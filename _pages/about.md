Hello! Welcome to my website! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University. I dedicate my career and research to the “One Health” framework that integrates human, environmental, and animal health. I approach this concept through computational precision environmental health and biomarker discovery from high dimensional omics and environmental exposure data. In my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have proficient knowledge and skills in microbial ecology, microbiome bioinformatics, microbiome epidemiology, machine learning, high dimensional data analytics, environmental toxicology, and wet lab techniques. My major research direction are listed below:

1. Environmental exposures and microbiome
We are exposed to a myriad of environmental pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products, metals, flame retardants, etc.) everyday. Individual or a mixture of pollutants may relates to changes in human gut microbiome and/or soil-plant microbiome, and subsequently impact human health. I have studied the associations of metal exposures and human gut microbiome [Shen et al., 2022. Environmental Health Perspectives](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9674); antimicrobial resistance and bacterial microbiome in lettuce-soil systems [Shen et al., 2019. Environment International](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105031); [Shen et al., 2021. Science of the Total Environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146255). Several more studies on caffeine, acetaminophen, flame retardants and their replacements exposures and gut microbiome are coming up. I like end-to-end details on microbiome. I am

In my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have proficient knowledge and skills in microbial ecology, microbiome bioinformatics, microbiome epidemiology, machine learning, high dimensional data analytics, environmental toxicology, and wet lab techniques. My postdoctoral research has focused on the association between environmental exposures, the childhood gut microbiome multi-omics (i.e., metagenome and metatranscriptome), and brain functions. I studied antimicrobial resistance and bacterial microbiome in lettuce-soil systems during my doctoral training. I have also been investigating novel machine learning and deep learning methods to learn latent space representation of high dimensional data (e.g., physicochemical properties of chemicals, epigenome-wide DNA methylation features, and environmental mixtures) in order to predict toxicity and disease. Another interest of mine is biomarker discovery using both statistical and machine learning methods to decipher exposure or multi-omics data. 

I am from beautiful and vibrant city - Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring good eats, fun places, and hanging out with friends. I sporadically make videos on interesting events around me at my [BiliBili chanel](https://space.bilibili.com/480150385).
