Hello! Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist at [Baccarelli Lab](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/laboratory-precision-environmental-health) at Columbia University. I am broadly interested in one health, microbiome, and machine learning. I am currently working on environmental exposures (metals, flame retardants, and pharmarceuticals), childhood gut microbiome multi-omics (metagenome and metatranscriptome), and neuro psycological outcomes (ADHD, MRI measures). I am also working on using machine learning to decipher chemical ecotoxicity and air pollution. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Crop and Soil Science â€“ Environmental Toxicology with a dual major in Environmental Science and Policy at Michigan State University in 2020. I received my BS in Environmental Science from the University of Alberta in Canada. I worked on antibiotic resistance and bacterial microbiome in lettuce-soil systems during my Ph.D. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring good eats, fun places, and hanging out with friends.

I am proficient in microbiome bioinformatics (amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing). Please navigate to bioinformatics service page for paid microbiome raw data processing service.
