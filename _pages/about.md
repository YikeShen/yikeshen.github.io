Hello! Welcome to my personal website! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist at [Laboratory of Precision Environmental Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/laboratory-precision-environmental-health) under the mentorship of [Prof. Andrea Baccarelli](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ab4303) at Columbia University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Crop and Soil Science-Environmental Toxicology with a dual major in Environmental Science and Policy in the Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences at Michigan State University under the mentorship of [Prof. Wei Zhang](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/wei_zhang). I received my BS in Environmental Science from the University of Alberta in Canada. 

I dedicate my career and research to the “One Health” framework that integrates human, environmental, and animal health. I approach this concept through computational precision environmental health and biomarker discovery from high dimensional omics and environmental exposure data. In my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have proficient knowledge and skills in microbial ecology, microbiome bioinformatics, microbiome epidemiology, machine learning, high dimensional data analytics, environmental toxicology, and wet lab techniques. My postdoctoral research has focused on the association between environmental exposures, the childhood gut microbiome multi-omics (i.e., metagenome and metatranscriptome), and brain functions. I studied antimicrobial resistance and bacterial microbiome in lettuce-soil systems during my doctoral training. I have also been investigating novel machine learning and deep learning methods to learn latent space representation of high dimensional data (e.g., physicochemical properties of chemicals, epigenome-wide DNA methylation features, and environmental mixtures) in order to predict toxicity and disease. Another interest of mine is biomarker discovery using both statistical and machine learning methods to decipher exposure or multi-omics data. 

I am from beautiful and vibrant city - Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring good eats, fun places, and hanging out with friends. I sporadically make videos on interesting events around me at my [BiliBili chanel](https://space.bilibili.com/480150385).
