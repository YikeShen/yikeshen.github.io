Hello! Welcome to my website! I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University. I dedicate my career and research to the “One Health” framework that integrates human, environmental, and animal health. I approach this concept through computational precision environmental health and biomarker discovery from high dimensional omics and environmental exposure data. In my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have proficient knowledge and skills in microbial ecology, microbiome bioinformatics, microbiome epidemiology, machine learning, high dimensional data analytics, environmental toxicology, and wet lab techniques. My major research direction are listed below:

1. Environmental exposures and microbiome.\
We are exposed to a myriad of environmental pollutants (e.g., pharmaceuticals and personal care products, metals, flame retardants, etc.) everyday. Individual or a mixture of pollutants may relates to changes in human gut microbiome and/or soil-plant microbiome, and subsequently impact human health. I have studied the associations of metal exposures and human gut microbiome [Shen et al., 2022. Environmental Health Perspectives](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9674); antimicrobial resistance and bacterial microbiome in lettuce-soil systems [Shen et al., 2019. Environment International](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105031); [Shen et al., 2021. Science of the Total Environment](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146255). Several more studies on caffeine/acetaminophen (paper under review) and flame retardants/replacements exposures and gut microbiome are coming up. I like end-to-end details on microbiome. I am dedicated to end-to-end microbiome analyses. I have streamlined microbiome bioinformatics (i.e., amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenome sequencing, and shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing) ([Bioinformatics Collaboration](https://yikeshen.github.io//markdown/)) and explored bacterial RNA quality and shotgun metatranscriptome sequencing (paper in prepration).

2. Deep learning models to predict chemical ecotoxicity and human health.\
High dimensional data are becoming increasingly common in environmental and biomedical research (e.g., omics). While we obtain much more information from high-dimensional data, they may contain redundant informations, therefore the ability to accurately predict outcomes from high-dimensional data is challenging. In major collaboration with Dr. Feng Gao, we have applied and improved autoencoder deep learning model to predict chemical ecotoxicity by learning latent space chemical representations [Gao F, ......, Shen Y*. 2022. Environment International](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2022.107224). We also developed a deep epigenome wide association study (DeepEWAS) method to assist early prediction of Coronary Heart Disease (paper in prepration). 

3. Fate and transport of contaminants in the environment.\
Accurately predict fate and transport of contaminants in the environment is a critical step in chemical risk assessment. In major collaboration with Dr. Feng Gao, we used machine learning models to systematically predict toxicity and select potential important features. The prediction suite of our works include: 1) predict pesticide dissipation half-life intervals in plants using molecular fingerprint [Shen et al., 2022. Journal of Hazardous Materials, Accepted](); 2) predict bioaccumulation of organic contaminants in plant roots from soils using molecular fingerprint [Gao et al., 2021. Environmental Science & Technology](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c02376); 3)predict crop root concentration factors of organic contaminants [Gao and Shen et al., 2022. Journal of Hazardous Materials](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127437). I have also performed a laboratory experiment on comparing root concentration factors of antibiotics for lettuce measured in rhizosphere and bulk soils [Shen et al., 2021. Chemosphere](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127677). 

4. Network analysis in epidemiology cohort studies.\
Exciting updates coming soon. Stay tuned!
