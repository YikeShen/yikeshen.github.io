## Introduction

* Microbiome sequencing price has dropped substantially, more researchers and companies are interested in learning microbiome in human, environment, and animals. Shotgun sequencing has enabled in depth learning of microbial community structure, pathway, functional potential, and active functions. One answer we ALL want to know about microbiome: Who is there, what are they doing? 
* Shotgun data is easier to obtain now than before with highthrougput sequencing platforms like Illumina NovaSeq6000. However, the data generated from shotgun is huge, usually ranges from 3G to 20G, more than 40 million reads per sample for shotgun metagenome. Shotgun metatreanscriptome is even more challenging, with more than 20G and 100 million reads per sample. For example, shotgun metagenome assembly and mapping can take up to 20 hours per sample! Shotgun metatranscriptome QC rRNA, adapter, human genome removal can take up to 30 hours computation time. Let alone consuming 100G memory during computation. Data processing is time consuming and requires the access to supercomputing cluster (HPC) or HPC cloud. Data processing also involves proficient use of python and unix in Linux system. Sometimes you just wanted to know who is there and what are they doing in your interested microbiome sample. It takes a great effort to learn python, unix, computing in linux command line system. In addition, not everybody have access to HPC.
