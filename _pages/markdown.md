## Introduction

* Microbiome sequencing price has dropped substantially, more researchers and companies are interested in learning microbiome in human, environment, and animals. Shotgun sequencing has enabled in depth learning of microbial community structure, pathway, functional potential, and active functions. One answer we ALL want to know about microbiome: Who is there, what are they doing? 
* Shotgun data is easier to obtain now than before with highthrougput sequencing platforms like Illumina NovaSeq6000. However, the data generated from shotgun is huge, usually ranges from 3G to 20G, more than 40 million reads per sample for shotgun metagenome. Shotgun metatreanscriptome is even more challenging, with more than 20G and 100 million reads per sample. For example, shotgun metagenome assembly and mapping can take up to 20 hours per sample! Shotgun metatranscriptome QC rRNA, adapter, human genome removal can take up to 30 hours computation time. Let alone consuming 100G memory during computation. Data processing is time consuming and requires the access to supercomputing cluster (HPC) or HPC cloud. Data processing also involves proficient use of python and unix in Linux system. Sometimes you just wanted to know who is there and what are they doing in your interested microbiome sample. It takes a great effort to learn python, unix, computing in linux command line system. In addition, not everybody have access to HPC.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
