Education
======
* Ph.D. Crop and Soil Science â€“ Environmental Toxicology, Michigan State University, 2020
* Ph.D. Environmental Science and Policy, Michigan State University, 2020
* B.Sc. Environmental and Conservation Sciences, University of Alberta, 2016



Work experience
======
* 2020.6-present: Postdoctoral Research Scientist
  * Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Columbia University
  * Investigated Association of childhood and perinatal blood metals with children gut microbiome in a Canadian gestation cohort.
  * Implemented machine learning models to predict chemical ecotoxicity. 
  * Streamlined shotgun metagenome and shotgun metatranscriptome analysis extraction, sequencing, high throughput computing bioinformatics, and downstream analysis. 
  * I am studying whether the gut microbiome can mediate the MRI brain measures, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) behaviors and diagnosis affected by different levels of flame retardants/metals exposure in childhood.
  * Supervisor: Professor Andrea Baccarelli


* 2016.8-2020.5: Graduate Research Assistant
  * Department of Plant, Soil, and Microbial Sciences, Michigan State University
  * Investigated the changes in antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) and bacterial communities in soil-surface- and overhead irrigated lettuce influenced by pharmaceuticals
  * Investigated uptake and accumulation of antibiotics, the associated impact on the bacterial microbiome assembly in growth chamber grown lettuce
  * Performed wet microbiology and molecular microbiology experiments to investigate Salmonella concentration, extract DNA, and run PCR and gel electrophoresis
  * Performed uptake and accumulation experiment, extraction and analysis of antibiotics using LC-MS/MS
  * Developed reproducible computational workflow to analyze high dimension ARGs data
  * Automated large 16s rRNA sequencing data analyses in high-throughput computing clusters
  * Supervisor: Professor Wei Zhang
