## I will join University of Texas at Arlington as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2023

My lab is recruiting 2 full-ride Ph.D. students interested in Environmental Health Data Science.

Welcome to my website! My research focuses on Environmental Health Data Science where I integrate environmental exposures, multi-omics, and health outcomes. The Shen Environmental Health Data Science Laboratory will approach this framework through computational precision environmental health and biomarker discovery from high dimensional omics and environmental exposure data.
